BUGS

(1) shiftReg1
    -shiftReg should be of type reg and not of type wire
    -begin and end are missing in the if else block
(2) shiftReg2
    -begin and end are missing in the if else block
    -indexing is wrong (should be {shiftReg[2:0], din} instead of {din, shiftReg[3:1]})
(3) shiftReg3
    -assign is used only for wires not for regs
    -even if assign was replaced with non blocking assignment operator, it should be in an always block for it to run on every clock cycle
(4) shiftReg4
    -even when we get rst we first write 0000 into register but then since it is a non blocking assignment we overwrite the zeros with previous values because the shift logic is not in an else block
    -we cant have 2 non blocking assignments for same variable running parellely as it is in determinate
