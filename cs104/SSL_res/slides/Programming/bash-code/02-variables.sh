# printing and using variables via echo and $

#Handling spaces
#{ } can be used to clearly separate the variable name from surrounding text. See below
echo -e "\n"

echo 1 $var$num
echo 2 "$varXX$num"
echo 3 "${var}XX${num}"

#Double quotes (“”) preserve the literal value of all characters with the exception of $, `, \
#In the first two commands, $ is interpreted as a variable with or  without quotes. 
#In the third command, bash intereprets * as wildcard and lists all files ending in .sh. 
#In the fourth, since it is inside quotes, it views it as * character and looks for a file named "*.sh"
