Introduction
------------

In this lab, you will learn to deal with trees.

The first problem is about finding the least common ancestor.

The second problem is an easier problem but involves a tree that
can have arbitrary nodes.

The third problem is about inserting in red-black tree.

Please try to get the first two done.
