Introduction
------------

In this lab, you will learn to deal with heap.

The first problem is about implementing the heap as we discussed in the lectures.

The second problem is a twist on the heap: You will implement a heap that supports any data type. Furthermore, we will implement efficient merging of sorted lists using a heap.

The third problem also needs a heap for efficient implementation.

Please try to get the first two done.
