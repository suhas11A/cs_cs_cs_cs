************************************ Problem 1 ************************************ 

DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IN FILES EXCEPT findlca.cpp AS WE WILL ONLY TAKE YOUR findlca.cpp FILE FOR EVALUATION.


Recall the definition of least common ancestor (LCA) from class and tutorial. 
Given a binary tree T and two nodes a and b, the LCA of a and b is the node v 
such that v is an ancestor of both a and b, and v is the lowest node with this property. 
For example, in the tree below, the LCA of nodes 4 and 5 is node 2, and the LCA of nodes 4 and 6 is node 1.
Tree:
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \ / \
4  5 6  7

0. We already discussed the algorithm to find LCA in tutorial.
1. Complete the function findlca(a, b) in findlca.cpp that takes pointer to two nodes a and b, and returns the pointer to LCA node of a and b.
2. The given tree is not necessarily a binary search tree. You may assume that both a and b are in the same tree if they are not NULL.
3. You have been provided with 10 sample testcases in testLCA folder. These testcases by no means cover all possible testcases. 
   You are encouraged to write your own testcases to test your code.
4. Check for all possible corner cases.
5. Note that there is no constraint on the number of nodes in the tree. 
6. To test your code, run the following commands:
    For auto-testing on given testcases:
    - make findlca
    For interactive testing:(look at what all interactive commands are allowed in main.cpp)
    - make interactive
7. Note that in testLCA folder, tree is given in tree<i>.txt file whereas label of nodes a and b separated by space are given in keys<i>.txt file. 
8. The expected output from all 10 testcases is given in expectedOutput/outputs.txt file. 
9. For example, for testcase 1, the tree is given in testLCA/tree1.txt, label of nodes a and b are given in testLCA/keys1.txt and the expected output is line 2 in expectedOutput/outputs.txt.
